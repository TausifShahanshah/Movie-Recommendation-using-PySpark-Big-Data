# Movie Recommendation with PySpark Big Data

This project involves building a movie recommendation system using PySpark, specifically focusing on handling vast amounts of data and implementing Collaborative Filtering with the ALS model.

## Overview

The dataset used for this project comprises 25 million ratings given to 62,000 movies by 162,000 user IDs. The primary objectives revolve around Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Spark SQL and implementing Collaborative Filtering to generate movie recommendations.

## Key Highlights

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    - Utilized Spark SQL for efficient handling and analysis of the massive dataset.
    - Explored various aspects of the data, including user behaviour, movie statistics, and rating distributions.

2. **Collaborative Filtering with ALS Model**
    - Preprocessed the data for model input, ensuring data quality and integrity.
    - Implemented Collaborative Filtering using the ALS (Alternating Least Squares) model.
    - Achieved an RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) of 0.81 on the preprocessed dataset, showcasing the model's predictive accuracy.

## Results and Conclusion

The project showcases the power of PySpark in handling large-scale data for recommendation systems. Achieving an RMSE of 0.81 demonstrates the effectiveness of Collaborative Filtering in predicting user preferences for movies.
